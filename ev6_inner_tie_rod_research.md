# 2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line Inner Tie Rod — Research Findings

**Date:** 2025-02-21
**Vehicle:** 2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line (Owner: Doc, Hawthorne NJ 07506)
**Status:** Active research — multiple strong leads identified

---

## Executive Summary

Three actionable paths forward, ranked by confidence:

1. **OEM Part 56540-AA000** — Genuine Kia inner tie rod listed for 2023-2025 Kia EV models. Available standalone from OEM parts retailers at ~$59-$86. Requires VIN verification for 2025 EV6 GT-Line fitment.
2. **MOOG EV80975 (Universal)** — 9.45" length, M16x1.5 rack thread, M14x1.5 outer thread, wrench flats on housing. ~$27-44. Closest dimensional match to OEM 247mm (9.72"). Originally cataloged for Mercedes-Benz but thread specs match.
3. **Beck Arnley tech line comparison** — Still the recommended phone call to compare outer thread lengths across their Sorento SKUs.

---

## CRITICAL: Thread Specification Discrepancy

The handoff document states outer thread spec is **M14x1.5 RH** (from AUTODOC/Moog dimensional data). However, independent sources show conflicting data:

| Source | Rack-End Thread | Outer-End Thread |
|---|---|---|
| Handoff doc (AUTODOC/Moog data) | Not specified | M14x1.5 |
| Teknorot HY-153 (56540-P2000) | M16x1.5 | M16x1.5 |
| Moog HY-ES-18192 (EV6 outer tie rod end) | — | M16x1.5 internal |
| Beck Arnley 101-8774 (in hand, fits) | Fits rack | Fits outer tie rod |

**Resolution:** The Beck Arnley 101-8774 is physically in hand and confirmed to thread into both the rack and accept the outer tie rod. The actual thread sizes are whatever that part has. Before ordering any universal part, verify with a thread gauge:
- Rack end: likely M16x1.5
- Outer end: verify M14x1.5 vs M16x1.5

If the outer thread is actually **M16x1.5** (matching Teknorot), then the Moog universals listed below (EV80975, EV428, EV415) with M14x1.5 outer thread will NOT fit, and you need to search for M16x1.5 on both ends instead.

## Path 1: OEM Part — 56540-AA000 (STRONGEST LEAD)

### What Was Found
The part number **56540-AA000** appears in Kia OEM parts catalogs as an "Inner Tie Rod" / "Inner Ball Joint Assembly" for 2023-2025 Kia electric vehicles.

### Pricing
- **Sale price:** ~$58.86 (31.7% off MSRP)
- **MSRP:** $86.20
- **Sources:** kia.oempartsonline.com, normreeveshyundaiparts.com (Hyundai equivalent)

### Fitment (Needs Verification)
- Catalog lists: 2023-2025 Kia Niro EV and electric models
- **EV6 fitment NOT explicitly confirmed** in search results — Niro EV is the only model named
- The "included with gear assembly" note appears to be a catalog description, NOT a purchasing restriction — the part IS orderable standalone

### Action Required
1. Go to **kiapartsnow.com** or **kia.oempartsonline.com**
2. Enter the 2025 EV6 GT-Line VIN
3. Navigate to: Chassis > Power Steering Gear Box
4. Confirm whether **56540-AA000** appears in the parts diagram for this VIN
5. If it does: order it. This is the OEM solution at ~$59.

### Why This Matters
If 56540-AA000 fits the EV6, the entire aftermarket search becomes unnecessary. Full OEM thread engagement, proper housing geometry, correct length — done.

## Path 2: Moog Universal Inner Tie Rods (If Thread Spec is M14x1.5 Outer / M16x1.5 Rack)

### Best Candidate: MOOG EV80975

| Spec | MOOG EV80975 | OEM (56540-P2000) |
|---|---|---|
| Overall length | 9.45" (240mm) | 9.72" (247mm) |
| Outer thread | M14-1.5 Male | M14x1.5 (per handoff) or M16x1.5 (per Teknorot) |
| Rack thread | M16-1.5 Male | M16x1.5 |
| Housing | Wrench flats on housing AND stud | Slotted ball joint housing |
| Construction | Forged, heat-treated, greaseable | Steel, 0.666 kg |
| Price | $27-44 | N/A (not sold standalone for EV6) |

**Pros:**
- 9.45" length is within 3% of OEM 9.72" — should provide near-OEM outer thread engagement
- Has wrench flats for tool torque application
- Greaseable socket (OEM is sealed)
- Lifetime warranty from Moog
- Price: ~$27-44

**Cons:**
- Cataloged for Mercedes-Benz C/E/S/CL/CLK/CLS/SL-Class (2000-2013), not Kia — universal fit, not application-specific
- "Wrench flats" vs "slots" — may require wrench instead of inner tie rod socket tool. Verify housing OD compatibility with your tool
- 0.27" shorter than OEM — negligible but noted
- Pre-applied thread locking compound (OEM did NOT use thread locker — this may need to be cleaned off per your preference)

**Where to buy:**
- CarParts.com: $26.99
- FinditParts: $35.99
- PartCatalog.com: $43.77
- PartsHawk: $38.60

### Other Moog Universals (Correct M16x1.5 Rack / M14x1.5 Outer)

| Part | Length | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EV80975** | **9.45"** | **~$27-44** | **Best length match** |
| EV428 | 7.39" | TBD | Shorter, less outer thread |
| EV415 | 6.29" | TBD | Too short — less thread than Beck Arnley |

### Moog Universal Reference
Full filterable catalog: **moog-suspension-parts.com/universal_inner_tie_rods.asp**
Filter by: Rack thread = M16-1.5, Outer thread = M14-1.5 (or M16-1.5 if thread gauge confirms)

---

## Path 3: Beck Arnley Tech Line Comparison (Still Recommended)

**Beck Arnley Technical Line: 1-833-897-0456**
Hours: M-F, estimated 8am-5pm Central (Smyrna, TN — DRiV/Tenneco)

### Updated Ask
*"I have 101-8774 in hand. The outer tie rod threaded section is too short — only 0.5" engagement vs OEM 1.5". Can you tell me the overall length and outer tie rod threaded section length for:*
- *101-8703 (2013-2018 Santa Fe Sport / 2014-2015 Sorento)*
- *101-8704 (Sorento)*
- *101-7799 (Sorento)*
- *101-8120 (Sorento)*
- *101-8528 (Sorento)*
- *101-5144 (Sorento)*

*I need whichever one has the longest outer thread section while keeping the same rack-end thread and slotted ball joint housing."*

### Why This Is Still Worth Doing
Beck Arnley has internal spec sheets with dimensional data. One of these SKUs may have a longer outer threaded section while maintaining the same slotted housing and rack thread. This is a 10-minute phone call that could identify the perfect part.

## Platform Sharing Confirmation

The 56540-P2000 (Sorento inner tie rod) was confirmed compatible with a wide range of vehicles on the N3/MQ4 platform:
- 2021-2024 Kia Sorento (MQ4)
- 2019-2023 Hyundai Santa Fe (TM)
- 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 5
- 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6
- 2023 Hyundai Kona
- 2023 Hyundai Palisade
- 2023 Hyundai Tucson

This confirms the electric rack inner tie rod is shared across many Hyundai/Kia platforms. The EV6 (E-GMP platform) likely uses the same or very similar inner tie rod.

## Moog Parts from Handoff — Status Update

| Part # | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EV801555 | REJECTED | Missing housing slots, confirmed not direct fit |
| EV800231 | Unverified | Could not find specifications in search |
| EV801212 | Unverified | Could not find specifications in search |
| EV801490 | Unverified | Could not find specifications in search |
| EV801491 | Partially verified | Listed as Sorento option on PartsAvatar, no dimensional data found |

**Recommendation:** The Moog vehicle-specific parts (EV801xxx series) for the Sorento have been difficult to verify dimensionally online. The universal catalog at moog-suspension-parts.com is the better resource — it lists exact thread specs and lengths. The EV80975 from the universal catalog is the strongest Moog candidate.

## Recommended Action Plan (Priority Order)

### Step 1: VIN-Verify 56540-AA000 (5 minutes)
Go to kiapartsnow.com, enter 2025 EV6 GT-Line VIN, navigate to Power Steering Gear Box diagram. If 56540-AA000 appears: order it (~$59). This is the OEM solution. Done.

### Step 2: Thread Gauge the 101-8774 in Hand (5 minutes)
Before ordering any universal part, confirm the actual thread specs with a thread pitch gauge:
- Rack end: M16x1.5 (expected)
- Outer end: M14x1.5 or M16x1.5 (conflicting data — needs physical verification)

### Step 3: Call Beck Arnley (10 minutes)
1-833-897-0456, M-F. Ask for dimensional comparison of outer thread length across their Sorento SKUs. This costs nothing and may identify the perfect Beck Arnley part.

### Step 4: Order MOOG EV80975 as Backup ($27-44)
If Steps 1-3 don't resolve, and thread gauge confirms M14x1.5 outer / M16x1.5 rack, the MOOG EV80975 at 9.45" is the best universal candidate. Order from CarParts.com at $26.99.

### Step 5: Salvage OEM Rod
If all else fails, pursue the 2024 EV6 eBay rack ($570) for inner tie rod harvesting, or search Car-Part.com/LKQ for individually pulled rods from Ioniq 5 or EV6 salvage racks.
